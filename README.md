# Fraud Detection Model

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for fraud detection in financial transactions. The model is built using a Decision Tree algorithm and trained on historical transaction data.

## Features
- Utilizes historical transaction data with labeled fraud instances.
- Incorporates relevant features for fraud detection.

## Preprocessing
- Handles missing values in the dataset.
- Engages in feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Scales numerical features to ensure consistency.

## Model
- Chooses a Decision Tree algorithm for simplicity and interpretability.
- Trains the model on a split dataset, separating training and testing sets.

## Evaluation
- Assesses model performance using key metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC
