# Fraud-Detection
This is the machine learning model for the Fraud detection. Here I have used the Decision tree.

### Decision Tree Model for Fraud Detection:
### Data Used: 
Same historical transaction data with labeled fraud instances.

### Features: 
Similar features used as in the Random Forest model.

### Preprocessing: 
Handled missing values, engineered features, and scaled numerical features.

### Model Selection: 
Chose a Decision Tree for simplicity and interoperability.

### Training: 
Split the dataset, trained the Decision Tree model on the training set.

### Evaluation:
Assessed performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. t
